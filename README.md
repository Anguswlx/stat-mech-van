The code requires Python >= 3.5 and PyTorch >= 0.4.1. If you have configured your PyTorch installation with a recent Nvidia GPU card, you can enjoy enormously acceleration (> 10x).

Directory `src_ising` contains code for 2D FM and AFM Ising model, and `src_hop_sk` contains code for Hopfield model, SK model and inverse Ising problem.

Run `python3 src_ising/main.py --help` to see all adjustable arguments.
